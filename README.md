# Sierra Store
Sierra Store is a video game database where users can search games across numerous different platforms. Users will be presented with images and a description from their desired game and also be provided with a link to the necessary external site where game can be purchased.  Game developers can submit their games to the Sierra Store game database. Administrators can approve, revoke, and send back game add request for additional review.

Sierra Store makes finding games simple.
